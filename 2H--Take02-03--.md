Notes:
- FIRST SHOT WITH BRIDESMAIDS, GROOMSMEN.
- Watch for leg of C-Stand that the Father is blocking. 
- Cut into shot a few steps in, for shadow.
- Through the middle of this shot, the Father moves the line to camera-left. The straight-on dolly should be fine to cut to, but be careful with the reaction shots.
