| AND KIDS. What if you can’t have kids? What if you CAN but they have mental or physical challenges or worse they choose drugs or end up maniacs? Have you even thought about this stuff for one second? Have you seen Real Housewives? You think you’re different? You think you have something special? Something that will help you beat the odds? And so what if you’ve known each other your whole lives. Yeah, I watched you both - growing up together, spending time with each other. But the fairy tale’s about to be over. This is a pipe dream don’t you think? A fantasy! A mirage! Real life is about to set in. The honeymoon’s over and then he’s farting under the sheets and you’re picking up his underwear, and she’s not quite as willing because of the headache and you’re never home because you’re working all the time, and Barbie in the next cubicle is staying late making eyes at him while Tarzan the pool boy just happens to drop by to help her with the groceries. How you gonna dodge those bullets? Huh? You better know the answer, or just do us all a favor, stop the charades, wait a few years, get a little more life experience. This is tough stuff. Maybe the toughest thing you’ll ever do. What unique quality do the two of you possess that’s gonna help you persevere? | Further up the aisle. People in the seats can’t believe what they are witnessing. |
