| Man in Audience: (Yelling) Wait a minute! Hold on a second! Sorry, but I gotta do this! (Back to normal) Have you seen the divorce rate? Don’t you think you ought to just move in together and see how it works out first? I mean, do you really want do this - put on rings and make a covenant before all of us and God? What if it doesn’t work out? I mean think about what you’re doing here and what you’re about to say. ‘Richer or poorer. Sickness and in health. Til death do you part.’ | A MAN from the crowd stands up.! |
